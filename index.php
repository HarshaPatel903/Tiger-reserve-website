		    The Biligirirangana Hills, commonly called B R Hills, is a hill range situated in south-eastern Karnataka,
			at its border with Tamil Nadu (Erode District) in South India.
			The area is called Biligiriranganatha Swamy Temple Tiger Reserve or simply BRT Tiger Reserve.
			It is a protected reserve under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. Being at the confluence of the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats,
			the Tiger Reserve is home to eco-systems that are unique to both the mountain ranges.
			The site was declared a Tiger Reserve in January 2011 by the Karnataka government,
			a few months after approval from Indiaâ€™s National Tiger Conservation Authority.
			The Tiger Reserve derives its name Biligiri (Kannada for white rock) from the white
			rock face that constitutes the major hill crowned with the temple of Lord Rangaswamy or from the white mist and the silver
			clouds that cover these hills for a greater part of the year.
